# Slugify

by [Jeremy Vaught](http://github.com/jeremyvaught)

================================

I'm still new to all this new age PHP stuff. But you should be golden of you add 

`'Jeremyvaught\Slugify\SlugifyServiceProvider',` 

to your `app/config/app.php` file under Service Providers.

and `'Slugify'         => 'Jeremyvaught\Slugify\Facades\Slugify',`

to the aliases section of that same file.

Otherwise, you might try my [workbench_slugify](https://github.com/jeremyvaught/workbench_slugify) project where I've implemented Slugify into Laravel to the best of my knowledge.
